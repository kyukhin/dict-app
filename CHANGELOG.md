## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- [Issue #4] iPad showed a blank white screen at launch. The `DictApp` target was iPhone-only (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = 1`), so UIKit launched the app in "Designed for iPhone" letterbox mode on iPad and never attached a window for the iPad idiom. Set `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"` in both Debug and Release configurations, which produces `UIDeviceFamily = (1, 2)` in the built `Info.plist`. Added unit test `testAppSupportsIPhoneAndIPad` and verified the app launches natively on iPad Pro 11-inch (M4) iOS 26.4 simulator.
- [Issue #7] Incorrect app display name. Added `INFOPLIST_KEY_CFBundleDisplayName = LibreDict` to the `DictApp` target's Debug and Release build configurations so the app installs on the home screen as **LibreDict**. Updated the in-app About section in `DictionaryManagerView` to show "LibreDict" instead of "DictApp". Added unit test `testAppDisplayNameIsLibreDict` in `DictAppTests` (passes on iOS 17.5 simulator) and also fixed a pre-existing GRDB async-overload build break in `seedEntries(count:)` (`pool.write { … }` → `try await pool.writeWithoutTransaction { … }`) that prevented the test target from compiling.
- App launch failed with `Database Error: SQLite error 26: file is not a database` on freshly-cloned working trees. Root cause: `DictApp/DictApp/Resources/seed.sqlite` is tracked via Git-LFS (`.gitattributes` declares `*.sqlite filter=lfs`); without `git lfs pull` the working-tree file is a 133-byte LFS pointer stub, which Xcode happily bundles into `DictApp.app`. At launch GRDB opens it and SQLite returns `SQLITE_NOTADB (26)`. Materialized the real 65 MB seed via `git lfs install && git lfs pull` (192,953 entries: wordnet + openrussian). Added regression test `testBundledSeedIsRealSQLite` in `DictAppTests` that validates the bundled seed file's magic header, size, and that `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entries > 0` — this will fail loudly in CI if the LFS object is ever missing again.
